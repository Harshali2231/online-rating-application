The Online Rating Application is a web-based (or mobile) platform that allows users to rate and review various products, services, or experiences. Users can register, browse different items, give ratings (typically on a 1 to 5-star scale), and write feedback comments. Other users can view these ratings and reviews to make informed decisions.
